We even keep the record of the victims phone number. There are two type of subscription FREE and PREMIUM. Free users will have a
quota of 200 sms/day and Premium will have unlimited sms. BLACKLISTING service is available for Premium members. You cannot spoof a Blacklisted number, so they are safe. Become a Premium member by <a href="https://www.paypal.me/samartha890?locale.x=en_GB">Donating</a></p>
